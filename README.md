**Strike Zone Difference**



Produce a visualization illustrating how the strike zone differs for right-handed and left-handed batters



**Getting Started**



To begin the assignment you will first need to download the data set from the Github. You will need to install the devtools package in order to import the data set from Github. 

`install.packages("devtools")`

`library(devtools)`

`devtools::install_github("Chrisboatto/Strike-Zone-difference/catcherframe.csv")`



Ideally you would like to produce the graphs side by side that way the visual is simple and the user is not needing to switch back and forth between separate graphs.



**Are you ready to begin?**
